Predicting Health Insurance Price for an individual or family
In today's world every single person wants a happy, secure and hassle free future for him/her and their family. For this reason, people are investing money in different purposes such as mental happiness like tours and travels, physical health like gyms, yoga etc., eating habits and so on. Even after spending lot of money for these wellbeings, people fall sick and they have to bare a huge cost for treatment very often. In the era of modern technologies and advancements, the medical cost for even a small procedure has gone very high in a decent hospital. Cost of medicines and medical tests are also very high.

In such a situation, it is very difficult for everyone to manage a good saving for all the family members. If savings fall short and the asking amount is high and sudden, people start to panic and it becomes a nightmare for them.

For these sort of uncertainties, Health Insurance plays a saviour's role for almost all classes of people. A minimum amount as insurance premium can provide people the confidence of always being ready for any urgent need.

As situation may vary, the need for medical expanses may also vary. It may depend on the treatment procedure and also depends on the seriousness of illness of the insured. Hence, the insured sum also varies from provider to provider. But, when the amount insured is very high, there is always a chance of fraudulent claims and the provider incurs a loss.

To prevent such losses, predicting the suitable insurance cost to be provided to the customers can be proved to be beneficial in the health care/insurance field.
